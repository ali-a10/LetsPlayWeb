1. events page:
    - make events more detailed (add other fields)
    - review explore events section
    - make sure http://localhost:3000/event-edit?id=X is accessible only
        if event w/ id=X is the current user's event

        - ALSO make sure only logged in users can go to that page
            - if no user is logged in and i go to the event-edit page, don't have the form,
            maybe redirect user to events page or put a message on a blank page


- handle case where users input random url parameters
    - e.g. /accountss
    - also handle pages that exist but users don't have permission to access
        - e.g. not logged in trying to access pages only for logged in users
        - DID THIS BUT DOUBLE CHECK^^^

to check:
- have to understand syntax on line 91 in datahandler: 
    // Replace the existing event at id with new data
    events[id] = { ...events[id], ...updatedData };

- use document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded'...) instead of $(document).ready()
    - some pages may have both


for later:
- when an event is first created, a popup appears & we stay on the event-edit page,
    maybe we can change the 'save' btn to 'back to events' once the event is 
    succesfully created
- ability to change password
- review gpt page on promises vs callbacks

- look into hashing login password
- have a place to see my past events (that I created or joined)
- have a loading icon (e.g. when clicking edit event, instead of seeing the empty
    fields for a sec then having the text load into them, have a loading icon
    until the fields are filled / when the info is retrieved from server)

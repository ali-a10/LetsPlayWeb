- remove writeJson from imports (this should only be used inside dataHandler.js)
- test the failure cases (where errors are thrown)

- check if we need to add and remove d-none in if statements, or is 1 of them 
    enough and it refreshes when the page is refreshed?


- check comment in app.delete('/delete-event/:id') in index.js
- update the update-event method in index.js and make sure client side is updated as well


1. events page:
    - make events more detailed (add other fields)
        - and sort them by most recently modified or created
    - review explore events section
    - make sure http://localhost:3000/event-edit?id=X is accessible only
        if event w/ id=X is the current user's event

        - ALSO make sure only logged in users can go to that page
            - if no user is logged in and i go to the event-edit page, don't have the form,
            maybe redirect user to events page or put a message on a blank page

    - have a 'more details' or something like that btn in the other event boxes 
        (events from other users)
        - this will lead to either:
            - a modified version of the edit event page that i have rn
            - a whole new page (create new file)

- handle case where users input random url parameters
    - e.g. /accountss
    - also handle pages that exist but users don't have permission to access
        - e.g. not logged in trying to access pages only for logged in users
        - DID THIS BUT DOUBLE CHECK^^^

to check:
- have to understand syntax on line 91 in datahandler: 
    // Replace the existing event at id with new data
    events[id] = { ...events[id], ...updatedData };

- use document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded'...) instead of $(document).ready()
    - some pages may have both


for later:
- group duplicate code into one view/partial view 
        (e.g. checkLogin then make btn visible/invisible)
    - THIS ^ will prob be done once i add react

- when an event is first created, a popup appears & we stay on the event-edit page,
    maybe we can change the 'save' btn to 'back to events' once the event is 
    succesfully created
- ability to change password
- review gpt page on promises vs callbacks

- look into hashing login password
- have a place to see my past events (that I created or joined)
- have a loading icon (e.g. when clicking edit event, instead of seeing the empty
    fields for a sec then having the text load into them, have a loading icon
    until the fields are filled / when the info is retrieved from server)

- account.html doesn't have the 'active aria-current="page"' code

- make indentation consistent in all files

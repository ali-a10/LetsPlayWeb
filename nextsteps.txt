1. events page:
    - make events more detailed (add other fields)
    - review explore events section


- handle case where users input random url parameters
    - e.g. /accountss
    - also handle pages that exist but users don't have permission to access
        - e.g. not logged in trying to access pages only for logged in users
        - DID THIS BUT DOUBLE CHECK^^^

to check:
- have to understand syntax on line 91 in datahandler: 
    // Replace the existing event at id with new data
    events[id] = { ...events[id], ...updatedData };

- use document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded'...) instead of $(document).ready()
    - some pages may have both


for later:
- ability to change password
- review gpt page on promises vs callbacks

- look into hashing login password
- have a place to see my past events (that I created or joined)
- have a loading icon (e.g. when clicking edit event, instead of seeing the empty
    fields for a sec then having the text load into them, have a loading icon
    until the fields are filled / when the info is retrieved from server)

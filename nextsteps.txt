- store rating and load it when visiting a user you've rated


- add to every user's page (both 'my account' and when viewing another user):
    - past events

these in order:
3. ability for users to rate and report each other
    - maybe each user has a rating for attendance and a rating for hosting

- BUG: go to my account, fav sports, each sport is displayed twice

- test the failure cases (where errors are thrown)

- might want to improve when user doesnt fill out a required field

- check if we need to add and remove d-none in if statements, or is 1 of them 
    enough and it refreshes when the page is refreshed?


- make sure http://localhost:3000/event-edit?id=X is accessible only
    if event w/ id=X is the current user's event

- handle case where users input random url parameters
    - e.g. /accountss
    - also handle pages that exist but users don't have permission to access
        - e.g. not logged in trying to access pages only for logged in users
        - DID THIS BUT DOUBLE CHECK^^^


- use document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded'...) instead of $(document).ready()
    - some pages may have both


for later:
- group duplicate code into one view/partial view 
        (e.g. checkLogin then make btn visible/invisible)
    - THIS ^ will prob be done once i add react

- when an event is first created, a popup appears & we stay on the event-edit page,
    maybe we can change the 'save' btn to 'back to events' once the event is 
    succesfully created
- ability to change password
- review gpt page on promises vs callbacks

- look into hashing login password
- have a place to see my past events (that I created or joined)
- have a loading icon (e.g. when clicking edit event, instead of seeing the empty
    fields for a sec then having the text load into them, have a loading icon
    until the fields are filled / when the info is retrieved from server)

- make indentation consistent in all files

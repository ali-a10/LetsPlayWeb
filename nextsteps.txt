1. events page:
    - make events more detailed (add other fields)
    - make event cards clickable (event page) maybe with event id in url?
        - if this is the user's event, make it editable


- handle case where users input random url parameters
    - e.g. /accountss
    - also handle pages that exist but users don't have permission to access
        - e.g. not logged in trying to access pages only for logged in users
        - DID THIS BUT DOUBLE CHECK^^^



for later:
- ability to change password
- review gpt page on promises vs callbacks

- look into hashing login password

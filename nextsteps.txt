1. make login page same as rest of website pages

2. check console when we go to events.html while logged in (getting a 400 bad request for get method)

3. check if we can addEventListener for logout button once in all 3 files
    - rn it's there in every files
    - we can prob do this easily in react but check if there's a way rn too


- review gpt page on promises vs callbacks

- session cookies to keep track of whos logged in

- get sign up to work

- look into hashing login password

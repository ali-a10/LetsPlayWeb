get my account save button to work for email and username
    - have to check that the new info doesn't exist

    ----- rn if i change the email, then save, it works
                - but if i dont refresh the page, and change username, it says email is already in use

1. check why 'navigating to page: login' is console logged 3 times when we navigate to a page

2. add text file database
    - UNDERSTAND PROMISES, async


- review gpt page on promises vs callbacks

- look into hashing login password
